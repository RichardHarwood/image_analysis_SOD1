In this repository is “image_anlaysis_sod1.ipynb”, the images (available on request) are associated with relevant information (mouse, ROI, Age, Genotype) which is stored in “sod1_mouse_ref.csv”. We  have also included a .html render of the markdown to serve as a reference. 
Furthermore, “image_anlaysis_sod1_no_renders.ipynb” is a carbon copy notebook that is essentially not run (that is, it includes 0 output)
